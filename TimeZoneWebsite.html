                The first time zone starts at longitude zero aka the Greenwich meridian. The meridian got its name from the city Greewich, England; this city is located on
                latitude zero. How this time map works is every time zone to the left or West of Greenwich will have a negative time, meaning they are what ever hour behind Greenwich.
                And every time zone to the right or East of Greenwich will have a positve time, meaning they will be however many hours ahead of Greenwich.

                Now the world uses Coordinated Universal Time which is the basis for civil time.
                The UTC was adopted in 1967 and it is adjusted to add in leap seconds to stay in line with the Earth's rotation. Greenwich Mean Time is now a time zone and no longer a time standard. 
                Timeanddate.com states that GMT and UTC share the same current time in practice.
