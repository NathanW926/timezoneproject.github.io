            <h2>U.S Time Zones</h2>
            <p>
                The United States of America first starting using the sun as a clock with noon meaning the sun was at its highest point in the sky. 
                A need for time zones in the U.S rose when the railroad was on the rise. Train schedules became confusing when using the sun at the highest point in the sky in different locations. 
                The History Channel states "On November 18, 1883, America's railroads began using a standard time system involving four time zones, Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific." All clocks in one time zone were then synchronized to the same time. The time zone system became official in 1918 Standard Time Act, this act also included
                daylight saving time. Now the world uses UTC and the time zones are divided into intervals of 15 degrees of longitude.
